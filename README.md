## Getting Started

Before you dive in, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

Node.js and npm (or yarn): Download and install them from https://nodejs.org/en.

Let's Set Up Your Development Environment:

### Clone the Repository:

Open your terminal and use the git clone command to clone your project from your Git repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Anupreet1213/video-dubber.git
```

### Install Dependencies:

Navigate to your project directory:

```
cd video-dubber
```
Then, install all the project dependencies using npm or yarn:
```
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Start the Development Server:

```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
This command will start a local development server running on http://localhost:3000 by default. Open your web browser and navigate to this address to access your application.
